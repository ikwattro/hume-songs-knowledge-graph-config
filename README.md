# Advent of Songs Knowledge Graph

[Michael Simons](https://twitter.com/rotnroll666) shared on Twitter the idea of doing the Advent of Songs instead of the typical advent of code.

We started it internally as well and we had so much fun that we did a Knowledge Graph out of it.

Here an overview of it
